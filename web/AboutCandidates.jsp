The BJP is a right-wing party, with close ideological and organisational links to the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
The official ideology of the BJP is "integral humanism", first formulated by Deendayal Upadhyaya in 1965. 
The party expresses a commitment to Hindutva, and its policy has historically reflected Hindu nationalist positions.                                                        </b><b>
                                                      <br> <br> The Indian National Congress (INC), often called Congress) is a broad-based political party in India. 
Founded in 1885, it was the first modern nationalist movement to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa.
From the late 19th-century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement, with over 15 million members and over 70 million participants.
The Congress led India to independence from Great Britain,and powerfully influenced other anti-colonial nationalist movements in the British Empire.
From 2004 to 2014, the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, a coalition of several regional parties, formed the Indian government and was headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 
As of July 2017, the party is in power in five states: Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Meghalaya and Mizoram. 
The Congress has previously directly ruled Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Goa.

                                                   <br>   <br>  The Communist Party of India (CPI)is a communist party in India. 
There are different views on exactly when the Communist Party of India was founded, but the date maintained as the foundation day by the CPI is 26 December 1925.
However, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), which separated from the CPI, has a different version that it was founded in 1920.
